# Software Requirement Engineering: Lecture 1 Breakdown

## Week 1

**Introduction**

This lecture introduces the field of Software Requirements Engineering (SRE). It emphasizes the crucial role of requirements in ensuring software projects are successful, meet stakeholder needs, and are delivered on time and within budget.

**Key Vocabulary:**

*   **Software Requirements Engineering (SRE):** The process of defining, documenting, and maintaining requirements in the software development lifecycle.
*   **Stakeholders:** Individuals, groups, or organizations who are affected by or can affect a software system.
*   **Requirement:** A condition or capability needed by a user to solve a problem or achieve an objective.
*   **SDLC:** Software Development Life Cycle

**Slide 1: Agenda**

The agenda outlines the key topics covered in the lecture:

*   Introduction to Software Requirement Engineering
*   Role of requirements in Software Engineering
*   The main risks of Requirements Engineering
*   Phases of the Requirements Engineering Process

**Slide 2: Software Engineering Goal**

The primary goal of software engineering is to develop quality software that:

*   Meets customers' real needs.
*   Is correct, reliable, maintainable, and user-friendly.
*   Has minimal total cost throughout its lifecycle.
*   Stays within budget.

*Analogy:* Think of building a house. The goal isn't just to build *any* house, but to build a house that meets the *specific* needs of the family who will live there (size, layout, style), is structurally sound and easy to maintain, and doesn't cost more than they can afford.

*Key Takeaway:* A "good" software product satisfies stakeholders' expectations regarding functionality, quality, and cost.

**Slide 3: Context: Stakeholders Environment**

This slide highlights that stakeholders are varied.

*Analogy:* Different people have different needs for a house. The parents might want a big kitchen, the kids might want a playroom, and the grandparents might want a ground-floor bedroom.

*Key Takeaway:* Software projects must consider the diverse needs and expectations of all stakeholders.

**Slides 4-6: Requirements in the Software Lifecycle**

These slides show the phases of the SDLC. While the number of phases varies (five, six, or seven), the key takeaway is that requirements are relevant throughout the entire software development lifecycle.

*Analogy:* Requirements are like the architectural blueprints for a house. They guide the construction process from start to finish, influencing everything from the foundation to the finishing touches.

*Key Takeaway:* Requirements impact every stage of software development, from initial planning to final deployment and maintenance.

**Slide 7: Introduction to Software Requirement Engineering**

This slide provides a formal definition of SRE: a critical phase focused on defining, documenting, and managing stakeholder needs and expectations. It emphasizes the systematic and iterative nature of understanding what the software should do, how it should behave, and what constraints it must operate within.

*Analogy:* SRE is like being a detective, gathering clues (requirements) from various sources (stakeholders) to build a complete picture of what the software needs to be.

*Key Takeaway:* SRE is about understanding and managing stakeholder needs to guide software development.

**Slides 8-10: Requirement: Definition**

These slides provide different definitions of a "requirement" from IEEE and Sommerville and Sawyer. The common thread is that a requirement is a specification of what should be implemented, describing how the system should behave, its properties, attributes, and any constraints on the development process.

*Key Vocabulary:*

*   **Condition:** A necessary state or situation.
*   **Capability:** The ability to do something.
*   **Constraint:** A limitation or restriction.

*Analogy:* A requirement is like a specific instruction in a recipe. It tells you exactly what ingredient to use, how much to use, and how to prepare it.

*Key Takeaway:* A requirement is a clear and documented statement of what the software must do or a characteristic it must have.

**Slide 11: Requirements Engineering: Definition**

This slide defines requirements engineering as the branch of software engineering concerned with real-world goals, functions, and constraints on software systems. It also addresses the relationship of these factors to precise specifications of software behavior and their evolution over time.

*Analogy:* Requirements engineering is like urban planning. It considers the needs of the community (stakeholders), the functions of buildings (software features), and the constraints of the environment (technology, budget) to create a functional and sustainable city (software system).

*Key Takeaway:* Requirements engineering bridges the gap between real-world needs and precise software specifications.

**Slide 12: By Proper Requirements Engineering We Can…**

This slide emphasizes the benefits of good requirements engineering:

*   Knowing what the system is supposed to do.
*   Keeping track of the status of requirements.
*   Determining the impact of a requirements change.

*Analogy:* Proper requirements engineering is like having a detailed map before starting a journey. It helps you know where you're going, track your progress, and adjust your route if needed.

*Key Takeaway:* Good RE leads to clarity, control, and adaptability in software development.

**Slide 13-14: Importance of RE**

These slides underscore the critical importance of requirements engineering. Deciding what to build is the hardest part of software development. Poor requirements engineering can cripple the resulting system and is difficult to rectify later. Good requirements engineering reduces costs and increases quality; poor requirements engineering leads to project failure.

*Analogy:* Requirements are the foundation of a building. If the foundation is weak, the entire building is at risk of collapsing.

*Key Takeaway:* Requirements engineering is the most critical and challenging aspect of software development, with significant consequences for success or failure.

**Slide 15: Significance**

Software requirements serve as the foundation for a successful software project, ensuring that the end-product meets the needs and expectations of its users and stakeholders.

*Analogy:* Requirements are the blueprint for a house; without them, the construction would be chaotic and unlikely to meet the owner's needs.

*Key Takeaway:* A good set of requirements is the basis for a successful software project.

**Slides 16-20: Role of Requirements in Software Engineering**

Requirements play a major role in:

*   **Communication:** Providing a common language for stakeholders.
*   **Guidance for Development:** Serving as a blueprint for developers.
*   **Scope Definition:** Defining the boundaries of the project.
*   **Project Planning:** Informing resource allocation and cost estimation.
*   **Quality Assurance:** Providing criteria for testing and validation.

*Analogy:* Requirements are like the constitution of a country. They provide a common understanding of the rules, guide the government in its actions, define the scope of its authority, inform budget decisions, and provide a basis for judging the legality of laws.

*Key Takeaway:* Requirements are essential for communication, development, scope management, planning, and quality assurance in software engineering.

**Slides 21-27: The Main Risks of Requirements Engineering**

These slides outline common risks associated with poor requirements engineering:

*   **Insufficient User Involvement:** Lack of user input leads to unmet needs.
*   **Creeping User Requirements:** Uncontrolled addition of new features causes scope creep and delays.
*   **Ambiguous Requirements:** Vague requirements lead to misunderstandings and errors.
*   **Gold Plating:** Adding unnecessary features wastes resources.
*   **Inaccurate Planning:** Underestimation of time and resources leads to poor quality.
*   **Overlooked User Classes:** Neglecting certain user groups leads to usability issues.

*Analogy:* These risks are like common construction mistakes. Insufficient planning is like building without blueprints. Creeping requirements are like constantly changing the design during construction. Ambiguous requirements are like using vague instructions that lead to misinterpretations. Gold plating is like adding unnecessary decorations that add cost and complexity.

*Key Takeaway:* Poor requirements engineering leads to various risks that can negatively impact project success.

**Slide 28: Phases of the Requirements Engineering Process**

This slide outlines the key phases of the requirements engineering process:

*   **Elicitation:** Gathering requirements from stakeholders.
*   **Analysis:** Understanding and classifying requirements.
*   **Specification:** Documenting requirements in a structured format.
*   **Validation:** Confirming the accuracy and completeness of requirements with stakeholders.

*Analogy:* This process is like conducting a scientific experiment: Elicitation is gathering data, analysis is interpreting the data, specification is writing a report, and validation is peer review.

*Key Takeaway:* The requirements engineering process involves eliciting, analyzing, specifying, and validating requirements.

**Slide 29: Why Requirements are Important?**

This slide is a summary of why requirements are important.

*Key Takeaway:* Requirements are the basis for a successful software project because they establish the foundation for what is to be built.

**Practice Quiz Questions:**

1.  Define Software Requirements Engineering (SRE).
2.  Explain the role of stakeholders in the requirements engineering process.
3.  List and describe three risks associated with poor requirements engineering.
4.  Outline the four phases of the requirements engineering process.
5.  Why is it important to have well-defined requirements in a software project? Provide at least three reasons.

**Answers to Practice Quiz Questions:**

1.  **Define Software Requirements Engineering (SRE).**

    Software Requirements Engineering (SRE) is the process of figuring out, writing down, and keeping track of what people want a software system to do. It's a systematic way to understand what the software should do, how it should act, and what limits it has to work within.

2.  **Explain the role of stakeholders in the requirements engineering process.**

    Stakeholders are anyone who cares about the software – customers, users, managers, developers, etc. Their role is super important because they're the ones who tell us what they need the software to do. We have to talk to them, understand their needs, and make sure the software meets those needs. If we don't involve them enough, we might build the wrong thing!

3.  **List and describe three risks associated with poor requirements engineering.**

    Okay, three risks of bad requirements engineering are:

    *   **Insufficient User Involvement:** If we don't talk to the users enough, we might build something they don't like or can't use. For example, an e-commerce site that's hard to navigate because the developers didn't ask users what they wanted.

    *   **Ambiguous Requirements:** If the requirements are not clear, the developers might misunderstand them and build the wrong thing. For example, if a requirement says "the system should be fast," but doesn't define what "fast" means, developers might have different ideas about how fast it should be.

    *   **Creeping User Requirements:** This is when people keep adding new features after the project has already started. This can make the project take longer, cost more, and be harder to finish.

4.  **Outline the four phases of the requirements engineering process.**

    The four phases are:

    *   **Elicitation:** This is where we gather requirements from stakeholders by interviewing them, doing surveys, or holding workshops.
    *   **Analysis:** This is where we try to understand the requirements, sort them into categories, and figure out how they relate to each other.
    *   **Specification:** This is where we write down the requirements in a clear and organized way, using documents and diagrams.
    *   **Validation:** This is where we ask the stakeholders to check if the requirements are correct, complete, and what they actually want.

5.  **Why is it important to have well-defined requirements in a software project? Provide at least three reasons.**

    It's important to have good requirements because:

    *   **It helps us build the right thing:** If we know exactly what the customer wants, we're more likely to build software that meets their needs.
    *   **It saves time and money:** If we have clear requirements, we're less likely to make mistakes that we have to fix later, which can save a lot of time and money.
    *   **It improves communication:** Good requirements provide a common language for everyone involved in the project, which helps avoid misunderstandings and makes it easier to work together.
