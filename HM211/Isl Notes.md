    *   Metaphysical (abstract reasoning)
    *   Positive (scientific)
*   **Physical Sciences:** Religion could be explained by the laws of nature.
*   **Sociological Theory:** (Emile Durkheim) Religion arises from social needs and reinforces social cohesion.
*   **Psychological Theory:** (Sigmund Freud) Religion fulfills psychological needs and desires.
*   **Historical Theory:** (Karl Marx) Religion as a tool used by the ruling class to maintain power and suppress class struggle.
*   **Theological Theory:** Religion is an inherent part of human nature.

## Religion & Human Nature

*   **Quranic Verses:**

    *   **Verse 1 (Surah Al-A'raf 7:172):** Primordial covenant: "Am I not your Lord?" and the affirmation, "Yes." This suggests belief is innate.
    *   **Verse 2 (Surah Ash-Shams 91:7-10):** Soul inspired with good and evil. Purification of the soul leads to success.

**Slide 2 Breakdown**

*   **Hadith on Faith and Sin:** This Hadith (saying of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him) emphasizes the importance of inner feelings as indicators of faith and sin. A believer feels pleasure in doing good and disgust in doing evil. Sin is what pricks your conscience.
*   **Belief in God (Iman Billah):** This section addresses the question of whether Muslims are allowed to question religious matters.
    *   **Quranic Verse (2:3):** This verse describes believers as those who believe "bi'l-ghayb," which some translate as "blind faith." The slide questions this interpretation.
    *   **Quranic Verse (5:101):** This verse appears to discourage asking questions. The slide argues against a literal interpretation.
    *   **Angels' Questions (2:30-33):** The slide uses the example of the angels questioning God's decision to create humans as justification for asking questions. God answered their questions instead of rebuking them.
    *   **Story of Moses (2:67-71):** This story illustrates how excessive questioning can lead to unnecessary difficulty.
*   **Is it unscientific to believe in the unseen?** This section argues that belief in the unseen is not unscientific, using gravity as an example of a reality that is accepted despite being beyond the reach of the five senses.
*   **Source of Knowledge:** This section outlines three sources of knowledge:
    *   **Intuition:** Inborn knowledge, such as the understanding of right and wrong.
    *   **Sense Perception:** Knowledge gained through the five senses.
    *   **Intellect:** The ability to analyze data and draw conclusions.
*   **Divine Attributes:** This section discusses the attributes of God, drawing attention to the harmony and order in creation (Qudrat), the fact that the natural world serves humanity (Rububbiyat), the experience of mercy (Rahmat), and the intelligent functioning of the universe (Hikmat).
*   **Alternatives to Belief in God:** The slide mentions polytheism, atheism, the theory of evolution, and the Big Bang theory as alternatives to belief in God.
*   **Knowing God More:** This section emphasizes that we cannot see God's physical existence, but we can come closer to Him by increasing our understanding of His attributes.
    *   **Quranic Verse (7:143):** This verse tells the story of Moses asking to see God and being denied.
    *   **Quranic Verse (6:104):** This verse states that no vision can grasp God.
*   **Principles about God's Attributes:**
    1.  All good attributes belong to Him.
    2.  All His attributes are perfect (qualitatively supreme and quantitatively infinite).
    3.  All these attributes are simultaneously operative.
*   **Manifestation of God's Attributes:** The world is a manifestation of God's attributes. Reflecting upon our surroundings in light of these attributes leads to true "Ma'rifat" (cognizance) of God.
    *   **Quranic Verse (3:190-1):** This verse encourages reflection upon the creation of the heavens and the earth.

**Key Concepts and Context**

*   **Iman (Faith):** The slide explores the nature of faith, emphasizing the importance of inner conviction and moral conscience.

*   **Tafakkur (Reflection):** The slide encourages reflection upon the creation as a means of gaining knowledge of God.
*   **Ma'rifat (Cognizance):** The ultimate goal of spiritual seeking is to attain Ma'rifat, a deep and intimate knowledge of God.

*   **Qudrat (Power):** God's power is manifested in the order and harmony of the universe.
*   **Rububbiyat (Lordship):** God's Lordship is manifested in the fact that the natural world serves humanity.

**Potential Exam-Style Questions**

1.  **Explain the significance of the Hadith on faith and sin in relation to Islamic ethics.**
    *   *Answer:* The Hadith emphasizes the importance of inner feelings and conscience as guides for moral behavior. It suggests that true faith is reflected in a person's emotional response to good and evil.
2.  **Discuss the Islamic perspective on questioning religious matters. How do the Quranic verses (2:3 and 5:101) relate to this issue?**
    *   *Answer:* Islam encourages seeking knowledge and understanding, but it also emphasizes the importance of humility and respect for divine revelation. The Quranic verses (2:3 and 5:101) should not be interpreted as discouraging genuine inquiry but as cautioning against doubt and arrogance.
3.  **How does the slide argue that belief in the unseen is not unscientific?**
    *   *Answer:* The slide uses the example of gravity to illustrate that scientists accept the existence of realities that are beyond the reach of the five senses. It argues that if there is evidence for the existence of unseen realities, they should be considered objectively.
4.  **Outline the three sources of knowledge discussed in the slide. How do they contribute to our understanding of God?**
    *   *Answer:* The three sources of knowledge are intuition, sense perception, and intellect. Intuition provides us with basic moral and spiritual insights. Sense perception allows us to observe the world around us. Intellect enables us to analyze data and draw conclusions about God's existence and attributes.
5.  **Explain the significance of the divine attributes (Qudrat, Rububbiyat, Rahmat, and Hikmat) in Islamic theology.**
    *   *Answer:* The divine attributes are the qualities that define God's nature and character. They are the means by which we can come to know and appreciate Him.
6.  **How does the slide connect the concept of "Ma'rifat" (cognizance) with reflection upon the creation?**
    *   *Answer:* The slide suggests that reflecting upon the creation in light of God's attributes is a means of developing true Ma'rifat. By observing the signs of God in the world around us, we can gain a deeper understanding of His nature and character.
7.  **What are the three principles about God's attributes outlined in the slide? Why are they important?**
    *   *Answer:* The three principles are: (1) All good attributes belong to Him; (2) All His attributes are perfect; and (3) All these attributes are simultaneously operative. These principles are important because they help us to avoid a one-sided or misleading view of God.

Okay, let's break down Lecture 5, "Belief in the Hereafter." This slide focuses on the importance of this belief in Islam and the arguments for its existence.

**Slide 5 Breakdown**

*   **Introduction:** This section emphasizes that belief in the Hereafter is a central tenet of Islam, essential for sharia, virtue, righteousness, and prophethood. Prophets foretold this "great news," and the Qur'an warns and gives glad tidings about this Day.
*   **Importance of Belief in the Hereafter:** The slide argues that belief in the Hereafter is necessary for a just and meaningful world. Without it, religion is mere wishful thinking, and concepts like virtue, piety, justice, reward, and punishment become baseless. The universe would lack purpose.
*   **Testimonies for the Hereafter:** This section presents five arguments or "testimonies" for the existence of the Hereafter:
    1.  **Man's Awareness of Good and Evil:** The conscience rebukes us for evil, acting as an internal court of justice.
    2.  **Man's Nature and Desire for Justice:** Humans inherently desire justice and dislike injustice, even if they sometimes act unjustly due to desires and emotions.
    3.  **Incompleteness of Man and the World:** While the power and wisdom of the Creator are evident, both humans and the world seem incomplete and lack ultimate purpose without a Hereafter.
    4.  **Attributes of God:** God's providence, mercy, power, and wisdom suggest that He will not leave humans unaccountable and will punish those who create oppression and injustice.
    5.  **Manifestation of God's Judgement in This World:** God has shown judgement in this world through prophets and messengers, who were given miracles and divine help to establish miniature "Days of Judgement" on Earth.

**Key Concepts and Context**

*   **Al-Akhirah (The Hereafter):** The belief in life after death, including resurrection, judgment, Paradise (Jannah), and Hell (Jahannam).
*   **Yawm al-Qiyammah (The Day of Judgment):** The day when all humans will be resurrected and judged for their actions.
*   **Jannah (Paradise):** The eternal abode of the righteous.
*   **Jahannam (Hell):** The eternal abode of the wicked.
*   **'Adl (Justice):** The concept of divine justice is central to the belief in the Hereafter.
*   **Hikmah (Wisdom):** The belief that God's actions are wise and purposeful.
*   **Rahmah (Mercy):** The belief that God is merciful and compassionate.
*   **Shari'ah:** Islamic law.
*   **Nabi (Prophet):** A person who receives revelation from God.
*   **Rasul (Messenger):** A prophet who brings a new scripture or law.

**Potential Exam-Style Questions**

1.  **Explain the central role of belief in the Hereafter in Islamic faith and practice. How does this belief influence a Muslim's life?**
    *   *Answer:* Belief in the Hereafter is a cornerstone of Islam, shaping a Muslim's worldview and actions. It provides a framework for understanding the purpose of life, the importance of moral responsibility, and the ultimate consequences of one's choices.
2.  **Discuss the argument that without belief in the Hereafter, concepts like virtue, piety, justice, reward, and punishment become baseless. Do you agree with this argument? Why or why not?**
    *   *Answer:* The slide argues that without a final reckoning, these concepts lose their meaning. If there is no ultimate justice, then the suffering of the innocent and the success of the wicked would undermine the very idea of a moral order.
3.  **Outline the five "testimonies" presented in the slide as evidence for the existence of the Hereafter. Which of these arguments do you find most persuasive, and why?**
    *   *Answer:* The five testimonies are: (1) awareness of good and evil, (2) desire for justice, (3) incompleteness of man and the world, (4) attributes of God, and (5) manifestation of God's judgement in this world.
4.  **How does the slide connect the attributes of God (providence, mercy, power, wisdom) with the necessity of the Hereafter?**
    *   *Answer:* The slide argues that these attributes imply that God will not leave humans unaccountable. His providence suggests that He has a plan for humanity, His mercy suggests that He will reward the righteous, His power suggests that He is able to bring about the Hereafter, and His wisdom suggests that He has a good reason for doing so.
5.  **Explain the concept of "miniature Days of Judgement" on Earth, as presented in the slide. What is the purpose of these events?**
    *   *Answer:* These refer to the events in the lives of prophets and messengers, where God intervened to support them and punish their opponents. These events serve as a preview of the ultimate Day of Judgment, demonstrating God's power and justice.

Okay, let's break down Lecture 6, "Islam and Morality." This slide discusses the importance of moral purification in Islam and outlines key moral principles.

**Slide 6 Breakdown**

*   **Introduction:** This section emphasizes that after faith, the second most important requirement of religion is the purification of morals. This involves purifying one's attitude towards both God and fellow human beings, which is termed a "Righteous Deed."
*   **Background:**
    *   The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said he was sent to achieve the culmination of high moral standards.
    *   The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said that the best among people are those who are morally sound.
    *   High moral behavior will carry the most weight in the scales on the Day of Judgement.

*   **Deeds are based on intentions:**
    *   On the Day of Judgement the foremost among people whose fate shall be decided would be scholars of the Qur’an or those who had been killed in jihad or those who had been blessed with wealth by the Almighty. They shall be brought over and the Almighty will remind them of His favours. They will acknowledge these favours. The Almighty will then inquire from them: “What did you do in benefiting from them?” The scholar will reply: “I was educated and then I educated others and recited the Qur’an before other people to call them towards You.” The soldier will say: “I fought in Your way and was killed.” The rich person will say: “I spent on every occasion on which you are pleased on spending.” The Almighty will say: “All of this was done by you so that people should call you a scholar, a brave person and a generous person [respectively]; so you have been called so in the world.” It shall thus be ordered and they shall be dragged faceward into Hell.
